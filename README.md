# Crispy Tribble

An arcade game written with as little code as possible.

## Project plan for v0.1

* [x] Add basic file structure

DoD:

* `html, css, js files are created`
* `html file contains basic elements needed to display essential game items`
* `css contains styles that give the html elements a basic structure und black and white look`

* [ ] Write function for game controls

DoD:

* `the element that represents the player can be visually moved left and right by pressing the corresponding arrow keys on the keyboard`
* `effects are smooth`

* [ ] Write function for generating random obstacles

DoD:

* `elements appear visually and (pseudo) randomly at the top of the screen and slowly move downwards until exiting the screen at the bottom`

* [ ] Calculate when collisions occure

DoD:

* `when the element that represents the player 'touches' on of the random elements which move down the screen a console.log is triggered`

* [ ] Calculate distance covered (eg. score)

* `a strategy is developed that tracks the players success (in points) throughout the game`
* `a counter is displayed at the top of the screen that shows the current points the player has scored`
